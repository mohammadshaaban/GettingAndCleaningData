###Getting and Cleaning Data - Project
###-----------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This project does the below:

The code in run_analysis.R does the following:
1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The CodeBook.MD file contains the variables used and their description
